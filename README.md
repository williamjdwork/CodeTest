# Frontend Code Test
## HTML/CSS Test
Use the PSD or JPG design file to create an HTML/CSS ready web page. Below is criteria for this project:
1. Photoshop design files are in the Designs folder. If you do not have Photoshop I have also included a layout.jpg to use as a reference. 
2. Layout should be responsive. We use Twitter Bootstrap for many of our project, but feel free to script this by hand or incorporate any other framework you are comfortable using 
3. Layout should be responsive down to Desktop / Tablet / Mobile. There is a folder with copms for each screen size.
4. You may use LESS or SASS for development, but traditional CSS also works
5. All images and SVG's assets are located in the Assets folder
6. Images should use srcset for responsive screens. This has been included for some assets, but others will need to be resized


## Javascript Test
Complete the javascript test located in Javascript / js_test.html. You may use either traditional javascript or jQuery to complete complete this.
